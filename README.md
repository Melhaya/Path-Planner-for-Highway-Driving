# Path-Planner-for-Highway-Driving

Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree - Path Planning Project

# Overview

### Simulator.
You can download the Term3 Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/tag/T3_v1.2).  

To run the simulator on Mac/Linux, first make the binary file executable with the following command:
```shell
sudo chmod u+x {simulator_file_name}
```

### Goals
In this project the goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. I was provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

The communication between the simulator and the path planner is done using [WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket). The path planner uses the [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets) WebSocket implementation to handle this communication. Udacity provides a seed project to start from on this project ([here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Path-Planning-Project)).

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

# Prerequisites

The project has the following dependencies (from Udacity's seed project):

- cmake >= 3.5
- make >= 4.1
- gcc/g++ >= 5.4
- libuv 1.12.0
- Udacity's simulator.

For instructions on how to install these components on different operating systems, please, visit [Udacity's seed project](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Path-Planning-Project). As this particular implementation was done on Mac OS, the rest of this documentation will be focused on Mac OS. I am sorry to be that restrictive.

In order to install the necessary libraries, use the [install-mac.sh](./install-mac.sh).

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

## Compilation

### The code compiles correctly.

No changes were made in the cmake configuration. A new file was added [src/spline.h](./scr/spline.h). It is the [Cubic Spline interpolation implementation](http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/): a single .h file you can use splines instead of polynomials. It was a great suggestion from the classroom QA video. It works great.

## Valid trajectories

### The car is able to drive at least 4.32 miles without incident.
I ran the simulator for 5 miles without incidents:

### The car drives according to the speed limit.
No speed limit red message was seen.

### Max Acceleration and Jerk are not Exceeded.
Max jerk red message was not seen.

### Car does not have collisions.
No collisions.

### The car stays in its lane, except for the time between changing lanes.
The car stays in its lane most of the time but when it changes lane because of traffic or to return to the center lane.

### The car is able to change lanes
The car change lanes when the there is a slow car in front of it, and it is safe to change lanes (no other cars around) or when it is safe to return the center lane.

## Reflection

The code consist of three parts:

### Prediction [line 101 to line 154]
This part of the code deal with the telemetry and sensor fusion data. It intents to reason about the environment. In the case, we want to know three aspects of it:

- Is there a car in front of us blocking the traffic.
- Is there a car to the right of us making a lane change not safe.
- Is there a car to the left of us making a lane change not safe.

These questions are answered by calculating the lane each other car is and the position it will be at the end of the last plan trajectory. A car is considered "dangerous" when its distance to our car is less than 30 meters in front or behind us.

### Dicision making [line 158 to line 175]
This part decides what to do:
  - If we have a car in front of us, do we change lanes?
  - Do we speed up or slow down?

Based on the prediction of the situation we are in, this code makes a lane change when it is safe. Instead of increasing the speed at this part of the code, a `too_close` boolean is created to be used for speed changes when generating the trajectory in the last part of the code. This approach makes the car more responsive acting faster to changing situations like a car in front of it trying to apply breaks to cause a collision.

### Trajectory [line 177 to line 302]
This code does the calculation of the trajectory based on the speed and lane output from the Dicision making, car coordinates and past path points.
